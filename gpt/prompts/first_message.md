The Odoo 18 add-on we are working on is for Outboard Parts Warehouse. The Odoo instance is
at https://odoo.outboardpartswarehouse.com. The local development environment is at http://localhost:8069.

Our add-on focuses on the workflow for the business. We buy outboard motors
either in bulk from marinas or individually from customers. We then break down the motors into parts and sell them. We
also sell new parts and accessories. The add-on has parts to test and create products for the motors we break down. We
have a Shopify store that we use to sell parts and accessories. We also have an eBay store that we use to sell parts and
accessories. We have a Shopify sync to manage our inventory and sales on both platforms.

Please get the file and folder structure of the main branch of the repository and wait for the next message containing
the goal of this interaction.
